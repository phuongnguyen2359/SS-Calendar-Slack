# Project - *SS Calendar Web*

## User Stories

Background & Overview: Silicon Straits office has 5 meeting rooms. We are currently using paper-based method to let our staff book the rooms. At each meeting room’s door, we place a printed calendar, when someone wants to reserve a meeting; he/she has to shade the time slots on the paper to indicate the booking.

Silicon Straits are hoping to replace these paper calendars with a modern LCD device that shows the room’s availability. Moreover, Silicon Straits are using Slack extensively for team communication; hence they would also require the team to implement a deep integration with Slack such that one can manage his bookings entirely via Slack. Silicon Straits do not have a fixed budget for this project; the team is free to propose a suitable approach to our needs with cost for our considerations. Once the technical approach has been approved by us, Silicon Straits will provide the team with necessary devices and hardware components to work on.

- [x] Users can chat with ChatBot to book a room. Example: users simply type Book + name the room.
